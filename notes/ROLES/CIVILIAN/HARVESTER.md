# Harvester
The harvester's job is strictly to harvest resources from the source. A secondary / late-game role is to harvest other things like Minerals and Deposits. Harvesters contain a MOVE and 2 WORK body parts. Harvesters should have a Hauler assigned to them. 

## Minimum Body Parts
- WORK
- MOVE

## Cost for Minimum Build
WORK (100) + MOVE (50) = 150

## Problems Associated with Harvesters
### Bunching
This problem really needs to be solved or Harvesters will never reach their full potential.

### Potentially Wasteful
Harvesters that don't do their own hauling can quickly become wasteful. Every time a resource is dropped, it begins to decay immediately. Cost really needs to be taken into account here as well.

## Variants
### Harvest Hauler
This hauler is for the earliest part of the game. This is a combination of the two roles of HARVESTER and HAULER

#### Body Parts
- WORK
- CARRY
- MOVE

##### Cost for Harvest Hauler
WORK (100) + CARRY (50) + MOVE (50) = 200
