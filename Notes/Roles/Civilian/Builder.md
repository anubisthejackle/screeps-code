# Builder
The Builder's job is to build everything in the game that needs building. This includes Upgrading of the room Controllers.

## Levels

### Initial Game
We won't be using Builders in the Initial Game, instead focusing on a combined Creep -- the [[Harvester-Hauler|Harvester]].

### Early Game
In the early game our Builders will be able to haul and work slightly faster than Harvester Haulers. They will cost us a lot more, but should be worth it. The total cost of the early Builder is 350 energy:

- (2) WORK
- (2) CARRY
- MOVE

### Mid Game
TBD

### Late Game
TBD

### End Game
TBD

## Problems Associated with Builder
Building is slow and expensive. Builders either need to take the place of a Harvester, or they need to pull from Containers / Storage. This leaves us with the situation of requiring lots of expensive Builders to build things quickly, while also not having the resources available to do just that.
