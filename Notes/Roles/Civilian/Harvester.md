# Harvester
The harvester's job is strictly to harvest resources from the source. A secondary / late-game role is to harvest other things like Minerals and Deposits. Harvesters contain a MOVE and 2 WORK body parts. Harvesters should have a Hauler assigned to them. 

## Levels
Harvesters come in various levels, based on the stage of the game.

### Initial Game
In the [[Initial Game]] we are running Harvest-Haulers. These cost us 300 energy a piece, and are composed of:

- WORK
- (3) CARRY
- MOVE

### Early Game
In the Early Game, we are now running just our early Harvesters. These are slightly more expensive at 250 Energy a piece, and are composed of:

- (2) WORK
- MOVE

### Mid Game
TBD

### Late Game
TBD

### End Game

## Problems Associated with Harvesters
### Bunching
This problem really needs to be solved or Harvesters will never reach their full potential.

### Potentially Wasteful
Harvesters that don't do their own hauling can quickly become wasteful. Every time a resource is dropped, it begins to decay immediately. Cost really needs to be taken into account here as well.
