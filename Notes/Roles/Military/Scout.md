# Scout
Scouts are extremely fast, but weak, Creeps. They put all of their focus in moving, so they can go lots of place, and see lots of things, all while being able to move in and out without being attacked.

## Levels

## Problems Associated with Scout
They're expensive, and all they do is run around for us. Scouts are excellent for patrolling a circuit around your base, however.
