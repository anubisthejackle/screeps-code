# Infantry
Infantry are less powerful Creeps that don't deal a ton of damage, but can be made quickly to help to overwhelm enemies as needed.

## Levels

### Initial Game
In the Initial Game we are not concerned with Attacking or Defending, as anything we lose can be rebuilt without much delay.

### Early Game
In the Early Game we are not concerned with Attacking or Defending, as anything we lose can be rebuilt without much delay.

### Mid Game
The Mid Game is where we start to concern ourselves with Defense. We should have enough available energy to begin our Army. For that purpose, we will start to develop basic Infantry units that will cost us 200 Energy to build.

- ATTACK
- (2) TOUGH
- (2) MOVE

### Late Game
In the Late Game we want to be able to put out a lot of Infantry. For that reason, we are only really increasing their Defense, and doubling their cost:

- ATTACK
- (22) TOUGH
- (2) MOVE

### End Game
In the End Game, we should have no restrictions on Energy, and will be able to load up our Creep as much as we'd like. These Infantry will cost us 800 Energy, but we should be able to push them out fast to help us Defend during a raid.

- (2) ATTACK
- (44) TOUGH
- (4) MOVE

## Problems Associated with Infantry

### When to have them
Having Infantry early means spending Energy on something that may, or may not, come to any use. We need to find a way to recognize when a threat is near, and only then should we start creating our Military.
