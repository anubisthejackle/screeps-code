Once we are at Controller level of 2 with our 5 extensions, we enter the Early game. At this stage we should have 550 Energy available to us for building Creeps. That allows us to make creeps faster, while also build faster, as we are able to generate more energy.

## Creeps
- (1) Harvester per Non-Wall Terrain that resides within 1 square of a Source
- (1) Hauler per Source
- (1) Builder Per Container

## Goal
- 5 Containers Built
- 10 Extensions Built
- Room Controller at Level 3
